# OOTD

This project is one to inspire others and share fashion trends. With never ending events and things to do in the city, there's always a need for inspiration when brainstorming what to wear for whatever activities you have planned. This meant to be a social platform where people can share the events they're attending and outfits they're wearing! There's also a page for upcoming events, and trending hashtags. 

## Core Features:

<ul>
    <li>FYP - For You Page is the timeline of posts.</li>
    <li>NavBar that allows you to switch from home page, to the events page and the trending hashtags page.</li>

    <li>A form to be able to add your own post!</li>

</ul>
